# Getting started with docker 

In this resp you will learn about what is docker and how you can create a docker project

### What is Docker?
Docker is a tool that lets you package your entire project, system, and all its dependencies into a single “box” called an image. You can run this box anywhere—no more system errors or missing dependencies.

### Why is Docker useful?
Imagine you have a Flask app. To run it on another computer, you’d have to install Python, Flask, and every other required package, and hope the versions match. With Docker, everything is bundled together, so it just works.
